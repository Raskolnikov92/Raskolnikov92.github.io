            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>My broader research interests lie on the intersection of information theory, statistics, and astrophysics. Due to my upbringing in theoretical high energy physics, I have developed a particular appreciation for a strong analytical and abstract way of thinking, commonly required in the fields of statistical mechanics and field theory. As modern astrophysics and cosmology become more heavily data-driven, the task of rigorously inferring useful information from data becomes increasingly relevant and crucial. Thus, given the deep connection between information theory and statistical physics, the understanding of these topics and their application to problems in astrophysics is an extremely fruitful avenue in modern astrophysical research.</p>
